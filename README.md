#  Shared Code for artifact available badge

This repository contains the source code for the TELO manuscript ID 39  "Pareto-Set-Prediction-Assisted-Bilevel-Evolutionary-Optimization for Bilevel Bi-objective Optimization Problems"

---
### Environment
Matlab 2022a

---
### **Usage / Examples**

Run the code under main folder (the folder where all source codes are) to ensure correct path during experiments

- For the main experiments for comparison with state-of-the-arts algorithms, run (with 30 parallel workers (parfor activated), takes up to 6 hours for all problems)

```markdown
psp_skip_para_runs_combined.m
```

- For the parameter analysis study, run  (with 30 parallel workers (parfor activated), takes up to 30 hours for all problems)


```markdown
psp_skip_para_runs_combined_for_parameters.m 
```

- For the comparison study with baseline EA and OS version, run (with 30 parallel workers (parfor activated), takes up to 48 hours for all problems)

```markdown
psp_skip_para_runs_toOS_combined.m

### **Outcome structure**

Results generated by the code is a cell array with the following elements related to evaluation:


|element no. | Description |
|:--- | :---|
|1.  | UL FE count |
|2.  | LL FE count|
|3.  | UL IGD (with one more value is normalize IGD) 
|4.  | UL HV (with one more value is normalized HV)|  
|9.  | run time|  
|10. | LL normalized IGD value of final ND front|
